<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>秋高马肥 - Horses are fat in the crisp autumn days. I consider it as the reason that my middle school insisted on organizing its sports days in autumn.</p>
<p>It was a late autumn day, when I, a senior student of the middle school, was watching my friend playing in a high jump competition. That was a dull game, if not the dullest one. Everyone knew who would be the champion. My friend’s participation was only for fun, and my attendance was merely on a pure purpose of maintaining the friendship. As the bar went higher, fewer jumpers stayed. Far before the bar reaching a stunning level, the number of contestants already shrank to three. I was not only astonished by the physical weaknesses of my cohorts but also surprised by the survival of my friend. More surprising yet was the fact that this insignificant scene rascally left a deep impression on my mind.</p>
<p>At the moment of the scene, a distant view was the sun moving towards the horizon, while a close view was the cocking smoke arising from the teachers’. For anyone who only worn a shirt that day, you could call it a chilly day. The whole game was approaching the end. People started to clear the field. In front of me, I found some leftover spectators, a careless judge, two expressionless jumpers, and my exhausted friend. All of us concentrated on that unprofessional bar, crudely made of a bamboo pole, and a ragged, dirty mat lying below the bar. Meanwhile, the last rays of the setting sun shone into my eyes, toned with all the things I saw, and produced a bizarre and motley stage. Then, my friend was about to take off.</p>
<p>Many years have gone by, and I have made countless attempts to erase this insignificance from my mind. But every time, when the season changes, when I stare at the afterglow at twilight, it will be revived. Those who were present - I forgot them entirely. The contact of my friend - I lost it a long time ago. The middle school - I never enter it again after my graduation. That jump - Was it a success or not? I don’t know.</p>
