<h1>
<span class="header-section-number">12</span> Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h1>
<p>If we could express the change of the milieu in a computational form, then the matrix computation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> could describe the generation and the transformation of such milieu. The input <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> could be stimulus and cause, and the output <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> could be reaction and effect. In other words, if the information of the current world were stored in a (huge) vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> in an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional <a href="#sub:vecSpace">field</a>, then the (linear) dynamics of this world were conducted by an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ch-MatComp.html#fig:MatrixTransform">11.2</a> shows the transformations of vectors in a 2-dimensional <a href="#sub:vecSpace">vector space</a>. We can see that those directions and orientations (in purple and red lines) remain consistent with the transformation. By stretching and compressing the directional arrows, we can scale their magnitudes (scalars) under which the transformation looks <strong>invariant</strong>. Generally speaking, this kind of <strong>invariance</strong> exists for any <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, and it is analyzable under the framework of <strong>eigenvalues</strong> and <strong>eigenvectors</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-215" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">215</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-215" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">215</span> For non-square <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> matrices <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, we can use an alternative framework of singular values and singular vectors. Roughly speaking, the singular values are the positive square roots of the nonzero eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{A}\)</span>. The corresponding eigenvectors are called the singular vectors.</span> <strong>Eigenvalues</strong> and <strong>eigenvectors</strong> can be mathematically defined as sets of <strong>invariants</strong> within processes of transformations. As matrixs can store all sorts of data information, eigenvalues and eigenvectors can in turn represent the corresponding “script lines” with clearly directional “stages”.</p>
<p>Perhaps the infinitely embodying milieu as computations of matrices makes the symbolization impossible. But as a conceptual ideal, the embodiment of eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide a way to recognize two seperated channels of forming one’s perception, the (concrete) material channel and the (imginary) spiritual one. The logic of using eigenvalues and eigenvectors - that is, the identification, the trace and maybe the selection of its various structural invariants - can reconfigure the relation of the input and output channels of the computation. Physical and metaphysical forces from the aspects in the ontology and the epistemology, form these complemenary channels in milieux.</p>
<p>As long as a secular transformation, such as a trade or a production, can be expressed in an input-output matrix form, the <strong>eigenvalue</strong> and the <strong>eigenvector</strong> can reconfigure the form as an epistemological and ontological emergence. Maybe I can call this process the <strong>valuation</strong>. The valuation here is defined as the emergence of quantitative “being” that attaches to the transformation, and remains invariant when the structure of the transformation unchanges.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Determinants, Characteristic Polynomials, and Complex Numbers</h2>
<p>The detective novel often depicts a fragmentary plot to drive the readers in a complete daze. When the readers were attracted by various bizarre and outrageous transforming scenes, the author, quite likely, had buried the solution clue in some unaltered remainders.</p>
<p>For mathematical transformations, in passing from one equation to the other, what was left unchanged is called an <strong>invariant</strong>. We will explore the invariant properties of the linear transformations through the <strong>determinant</strong>. A <em>determinant</em> of a square matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span>, is a function mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> to a <a href="sub-continuity.html#sub:completeness">real number</a>. This real number contains the information about the product of all <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">pivots</a> of the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">echelon form</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider a <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> matrix <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{A}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12}\\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22}
\end{array}\right].\]</span>
The pivots of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(a_{11}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{22}-(a_{21}/a_{11})a_{12}\)</span>. The product of these pivots is <span class="math inline">\(a_{11}(a_{22}-(a_{21}/a_{11})a_{12})=a_{11}a_{22}-a_{21}a_{12}\)</span>. The <strong>determinant</strong> is sometimes written with a single straight line as left and right brackets. So we would write the above result as <span class="math display">\[\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})=\left|\begin{array}{cc}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12}\\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22}
\end{array}\right|=a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}.\]</span></p>
<p>If we think of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> as two row vectors in the plane, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=[\mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{2}]^{\top}\)</span>, then the <strong>determinant</strong> is the (signed) area of the parallelogram spanned by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}_{2}\)</span>. The sign of the <strong>determinant</strong> is positive (negative) if the two vectors are positively (negatively) oriented. Figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:det">12.1</a> shows a parallelogram spanned by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{z}=[5,1]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}=[-1,3]\)</span>.</p>

<p>For an <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">invertible</a> <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, its <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">echelon form</a> says that all <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">pivots</a> are non-zero<label for="tufte-sn-216" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">216</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-216" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">216</span> As the statement in section <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">11.2</a>, the <strong>determinant</strong> also relates the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">invertibility</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>. A zero <strong>determinant</strong> induces a non-invertible/singular square matrix.</span>, so is the product of all pivots, namely <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\neq 0\)</span>. Geometrically, the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span> is equal to the volume of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional parallelepiped, where the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by the column or row vectors of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-217" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">217</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-217" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">217</span> The <strong>determinant</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> preserves or reverses the orientation of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. The absolute value of the determinant can be thought of as a measure of how much multiplication by the matrix expands or contracts the space of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. If the determinant is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then space is contracted completely along at least one dimension, causing it to lose all of its volume. If the determinant is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then the transformation preserves volume.</span></p>
<p>Here is a list of some properties (facts) of the <strong>determinant</strong> of a square <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{I})=1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})=0\)</span>, if the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">singular</a> or <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">non-invertible</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Swapping two vectors of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> changes the sign of <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{ij}\mathbf{A})=-\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}_{ij}\)</span> is the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">permutation elementary matrix</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Scaling a row or a column of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> scales the determinant. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{i}(c)\mathbf{A})=c \times \mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}_{i}(c)\)</span> is the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">scaling elementary matrix</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>For the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">replacement elementary matrix</a>, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{ij}(s)\mathbf{A})=\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the <strong>determinants</strong> of triangular matrices and diagonal matrices are exactly the product of the diagonal entries in those matrices. Fact 1) comes directly from the product of ones on the diagonal of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{I}\)</span>. Fact 2) comes from the definition. Figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:det">12.1</a> gives an example of 3). For 4), figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:Scalingdet">12.2</a> shows how the scaling transformation changes the determinant (the area of the parallelogram). For fact 5), figure <a href="ch-MatComp.html#fig:GElimination">11.1</a> shows that in the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">Gaussian elimination</a> procedures, forming the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">echelon form</a> do not affect the volume. In other words, the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">replacement elementary matrices</a> simply rotate the intersections of the parallelepiped, and preserve the volume.</p>

<p>The <em>determinant</em> of a square <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=[a_{ij}]\)</span> is the scalar quantity <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span> that is recursively defined by the following expression: If <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}\mathbf{A}=a_{11}\)</span>; otherwise, it follows<span class="math display">\[\mbox{det}\mathbf{A}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k1}(-1)^{k+1}\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}_{(k)1})\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}_{(k)1})\)</span> is the <strong>determinant</strong> of the <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\times(n-1)\)</span> matrix obtained from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> by deleting the first row and the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th coloumn of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The idea of this formula is to split an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> matrix by crossing out row <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and column <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to get a (sub)matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}_{(k)1}\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>.

<p>For 6), notice that <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_i (c))=c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{ij})=-1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{ij}(s))=1\)</span>.

\begin{align*}
\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{i}(c)\mathbf{A})&amp;=\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{i}(c)) \mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})=c\times \mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}),\\

<p>Therefore, all mutiplications of the square matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> by the elementary matrices <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span> satisfy <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}\mathbf{A})=\mbox{det}(\mathbf{E}_{i})\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A}).\)</span> Because <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is invertible, we can express it as a product of elementary matrices (see the proof in section <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">11.2</a>), say <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{E}^{(1)}\mathbf{E}^{(2)}\cdots\mathbf{E}^{(k)}\)</span>.

<p>To see the use of determinant, let’s return to the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearity">fixed point problem</a> in the matrix form <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}\)</span> where the transformation is invariant around the solution <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">invertible</a> matrix, we will see that the existence of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span> can be determinated by the <strong>determinant</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that the fixed point problem can be presented as <span class="math inline">\(0=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> or <span class="math display">\[0=(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})\mathbf{x}.\]</span> The statement 4) in section <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">11.2</a> says that for an invertible matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})\mathbf{x}=0\)</span> has a unique solution <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}=0\)</span>. This statement implies that if we are looking for a non-zero solution of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span>, we should expect that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})}\)</span> to be <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">singular</a> or non-invertible, namely <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})=0\)</span>. In this way, the existence of a non-zero fixed point solution <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span> is equivalent to a zero <strong>determinant</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The linear transformation of the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearity">fixed point problem</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}^{*}=1\times \mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span> preserve the invariant <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span>. We can call the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}^{*}\)</span> the <strong>eigenvector</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> with <strong>eigenvalue</strong> <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. The formal definition of <strong>eigenvector</strong> and <strong>eigenvalue</strong> is given by the <strong>characteristic polynomial</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Eigenvector</strong>, <strong>eigenvalue</strong>, <strong>characteristic polynomial</strong> : Consider an <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span>
matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times n}\)</span>, where the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:vecSpaces">field</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}\)</span> can be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>
or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. The <em>eigenvalues</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>
are the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> roots, <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda=\{\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n}\}\)</span>, of its <em>characteristic polynomial</em> <span class="math display">\[\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}).\]</span> The set of these roots is called the <em>spectrum</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, and it can also be written as<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{S}=\{\lambda \in {\mathbb{C}} \,:\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})=0\}.\]</span>
For any <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\in\mathcal{S}\)</span>, the non-zero vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{C}^{n}\)</span> that satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}\)</span> is an <em>eigenvector</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition says that solving the <strong>characteristic polynomial</strong> gives us the <strong>eigenvalues</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Given the <strong>eigenvalues</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the solution of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}\)</span> (or as a fixed point problem: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{A}/\lambda)\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}\)</span>) gives the corresponding <strong>eigenvectors</strong>. All the information of the transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}\)</span> is now preserved by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \mathbf{v}\)</span>. In other words, the information of linear transformations <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is stored by the pairs <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some straightforward properties about the eigenvalues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\mathbf{I}\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})=\mbox{det}(\Lambda)=\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\cdots\lambda_{n}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})=0\)</span>, the determinant fact 7) implies <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I})=\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\mathbf{I}=\Lambda\)</span> is a diagonal matrix, so <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\Lambda)=\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\cdots\lambda_{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We will consider more examples about eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the following sections. At the moment, we focus on the illumination of <strong>invariant property</strong> given by the <strong>characteristic polynomial</strong> and its <strong>determinant</strong>.<label for="tufte-sn-218" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">218</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-218" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">218</span> Our exposition introduced matrices first and <strong>determinants</strong> later, however the historical order of discovery was the opposite: determinants were known long before matrices. Also, the recognition of an invariant as an quantitative object in its own interest emerged together with the determinants (characteristic polynomials).</span>
Perphas, the most familiar <strong>invariant</strong> for a polynomial is the discriminant <span class="math inline">\(b^{2}-ac\)</span> from a quadratic form (a bivariate polynomial) <span class="math display">\[ax_{2}^{2}+2bx_{1}x_{2}+cx_{2}^{2}.\]</span> The discriminant indicates properties of the roots for this bivariate polynomial regardless the specific values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. One feature about this <strong>invariant</strong> is that after any linear transformation vector <span class="math inline">\([x_{1},x_{2}]\)</span>, the discriminat <span class="math inline">\(b^{2}-ac\)</span> still works.</p>
<p>The discriminant of bivariate polynomials illuminates that searching the invariant property may receive more rewards than calculating a specific solution. The solution of the polynomial varies when the polynomial is changed by the structure (coefficients), but the discriminant formula remains unchanged. Moerover, the formula also determines the new solution values. Thus, when we face various systems, it may be more worthy to find the invariant shared by these systems rather than solve each system one by one.</p>
<p>In an economy of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-sectors, one can model both the supply and the demand system of this economy by polynomials. That is, if we have one system, say the supply system, of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-factors (variables), and we expect that there is another corresponding but different system of the same factors.<label for="tufte-sn-219" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">219</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-219" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">219</span> The factors in different sides may require different quantities, so these two system cannot have the same form.</span> Suppose the factor in the demand side (output) has to be transformed from the supply side (input). An <strong>invariant</strong> of this economy means that the transformation for the factors can equate the supply system with the demand one for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-sectors. We use a quantitative model to illustrate how to identify the <strong>invariant</strong>.</p>

<p>So far, we only saw the univariate polynomial.

We consider a system of <em>multivariate polynomials</em> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-unknowns and with the total order of the <strong>monomial</strong> less than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[\mathcal{P}_{n}(\mathcal{V})=\left\{ \left.f(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i}c_{i}x_{1}^{\alpha_{i,1}}x_{2}^{\alpha_{i.2}}\cdots x_{n}^{\alpha_{i,n}}\right|\,\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{V},\quad\alpha_{i,1}+\cdots+\alpha_{i,n}\leq n,\:\alpha_{i,j},\:\alpha_{i,j}\in\mathbb{N}^{+} \right\} \]</span></p>
<p>In this general <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th order <strong>multivariate polynomial</strong> system, the invariants under the linear transformation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> relate to the determinants of the transformation. Suppose the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}\)</span> is linearly transformed from the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=[a_{ij}]_{n\times n}\)</span>. Assume that the supply function <span class="math inline">\(p(\mathbf{x})\)</span>, and the demand function <span class="math inline">\(q(\mathbf{y})\in\mathcal{P}_{n}(\mathcal{V})\)</span> are two multivariate polynomials with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> unknown quantities in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-sectors.</p>
<p>If there is an <strong>invariant</strong> in <span class="math inline">\(p(\mathbf{x})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q(\mathbf{y})\)</span> by making <span class="math inline">\(p(\mathbf{x})=q(\mathbf{y})\)</span>, then any <a href="sub-calculus.html#sub:diffInt">infinitesimal changes</a> of <span class="math inline">\(p(\mathbf{x})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q(\mathbf{x})\)</span> should not violate the equality. So we expect that after taking the partial derivatives the equality still holds:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial y_{1}}\frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{1}}+\cdots+&amp;\frac{\partial p}{\partial y_{n}}\frac{\partial y_{n}}{\partial x_{1}}   =\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_{1}},\\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial y_{1}}\frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{2}}+\cdots+&amp;\frac{\partial p}{\partial y_{n}}\frac{\partial y_{n}}{\partial x_{2}}   =\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_{2}},\\
\vdots &amp; \qquad \quad  \vdots      \\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial y_{1}}\frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{1}}+\cdots+&amp;\frac{\partial p}{\partial y_{n}}\frac{\partial y_{n}}{\partial x_{n}}   =\frac{\partial q}{\partial x_{n}}.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> or
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_{1}+\cdots+a_{1n}x_{n}  &amp;=y_{1},\\

<p>we can see that <span class="math inline">\(\partial y_{i}/\partial x_{j}=a_{ij}\)</span>.
So the above system can be expressed as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\nabla p=\nabla q\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\nabla p=[\partial p/\partial y_{i}]_{n\times1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\nabla q=[\partial q/\partial x_{i}]_{n\times1}\)</span>
are the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearity">gradient vectors</a>. If the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearity">infinitesimal changes</a> of <span class="math inline">\(q(\mathbf{x})\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\nabla q\)</span>, is zero, then we expect <span class="math inline">\(\nabla p\)</span> to be zero. In other words, the linear system <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\nabla p=0\)</span> has the solution <span class="math inline">\(\nabla p=0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\neq0\)</span>. (Statement 4 in section <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:matInv">11.2</a>.)</p>
<p>Thus the condition <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{det}(\mathbf{A})\neq0\)</span> is to ensure the existence of the <strong>invariant</strong> in this system.
Then <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">Gaussian elimination</a> can reduce the linear system <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\nabla p= 0\)</span> to an expression of the invariant.</p>
<p>The idea of this method, an algebra perspective of bridging the invariance and the determinant of the partially differentiable transformation (the coefficient matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>), was first proposed by <span class="citation">Boole (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Boole1841">1841</a>)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-221" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">221</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-221" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">221</span> Some British mathematicians even said the study of partial differential equations was initiated by the exploration of the invariant.

</p>
<p>The proof of theorem is beyond our concern. But figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:FTA">12.4</a> gives a rough idea why the theorem works. Suppose we restrict the domain of a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> to a circle <span class="math inline">\(|z|\leq r\)</span> where any <span class="math inline">\(z\in\mathbb{C}\)</span> is a complex number. Then by enlarging the radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> of the circle, the image (cross-hatching area) <span class="math inline">\(\{f(z): \, |z|\leq r \}\)</span> will sooner or later cover the zero origin, namely <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=0\)</span> has a solution <span class="math inline">\(z^*\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(|z^*|\leq r\)</span>. This may not be the case if we restrict the domain to a real line of the complex plane.</p>
<p>By the theorem, we can deduce that the complex number system is in the sense of a complete system such that we can solve any polynomial equation in it. The highest degree of a polynomial gives you the highest possible number of distinct complex roots for the polynomial.</p>
<p>Due to the importance of complex number system, hereby we review some basic concepts, and provide some interpretations about the <em>complex number system</em> <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{C}=\{a+\mbox{i}b:\, a,b\in\mathbb{R}\}.\]</span>
For a complex number <span class="math inline">\(z\in\mathbb{C}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z=a+\mbox{i}b\)</span> is the standard form. The <em>real part</em> of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is written as <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Re}(z)=a\)</span>, and the <em>imaginary part</em> is written as <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{Im}(z)=b\)</span>. The imaginary number <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{i}\)</span> satisfies the algebraic identity <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{i}^{2}=-1\)</span>. The <em>complex conjugate</em> of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, having the same real part of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> but the opposite imaginary part, is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}=a-\mbox{i}b\)</span>. Two complex numbers are equal precisely when they have the same <strong>real part</strong> and the same <strong>imaginary part</strong>.</p>
<p>One can also consider that the complex numbers as <a href="sub-set-theory.html#sub:order">ordered pairs</a> of <a href="sub-continuity.html#sub:completeness">real numbers</a> satisfying the <em>law of complex arithmetic</em>. As complex numbers behave like ordered pairs of real numbers, they can be identified with points in the plane. Real numbers go along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, and imaginary numbers are on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis. This gives the complex plane. Arithmetic of addition and subtraction in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> is carried out like adding and subtracting vectors in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{2}\)</span>.

<p>For the multiplication of complex numbers, it may be more straightforward to consider under the <a href="sub-inferknow.html#sub:histgeo">polar coordinate</a>.

Also, for the complex multiplication of <span class="math inline">\(z_1=r_1\mbox{e}^{\mbox{i}\theta_1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_2=r_2\mbox{e}^{\mbox{i}\theta_2}\)</span>, it is all about rescaling the absolute value to <span class="math inline">\(r_1\times r_2\)</span> and rotating the angle to <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1+\theta_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The complex multiplication on a unit circle also relates to a linear transformation.
From figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:complexPolar">12.5</a>, we can see that a rotation of the plane on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{2}\)</span> around the origin through angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a linear transformation that sends the basis vectors <span class="math inline">\([1,0]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\([\cos\theta,\sin\theta]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([-\sin\theta,\cos\theta]\)</span>, respectively. Let’s denote this transofrmation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_{\theta}\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{T}_{\theta}\left(x\left[\begin{array}{c}
1\\
0
\end{array}\right]+y\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1
\end{array}\right]\right)=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x\cos\theta-y\sin\theta\\
x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta
\end{array}\right].\]</span>
In fact, this linear transformation can be represented by the matrix <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{T}_{\theta}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\cos\theta &amp; -\sin\theta\\
\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta
\end{array}\right].\]</span>
We call <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_{\theta}\)</span> the <em>rotation matrix</em> with the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>.
Notice that for an arbitrary point <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> on the complex plane, the rotation of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> angle simply says <span class="math display">\[(\cos\theta+\mbox{i}\sin\theta)(x+\mbox{i}y)=x\cos\theta-y\sin\theta+\mbox{i}(x\sin\theta+y\cos\theta).\]</span>
That is, each rotation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_{\theta}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{2}\)</span> can represent the complex number <span class="math inline">\(\cos\theta+\mbox{i}\sin\theta\)</span>.</p>
<p>By decomposing the <strong>rotation matrix</strong> <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{T}_{\theta}=\cos\theta\underset{\mathbf{B}_{1}}{\underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]}}+\sin\theta\underset{\mathbf{B}_{2}}{\underbrace{\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; -1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right]}},\]</span>
we represent the rotation by the matrices <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}_2\)</span>. One can verify that these two matrices behave exactly the same as the numbers <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}_1=\mathbf{I}\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{i}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}_2 \mathbf{B}_2= - \mathbf{I}\)</span>). In fact, any <span class="math display">\[\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a &amp; -b\\
b &amp; a
\end{array}\right]=a\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]+b\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; -1\\
1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right],\; a,b\in\mathbb{R}\]</span>
behaves exactly the same as the complex number <span class="math inline">\(a+\mbox{i}b\)</span> under addition and multiplication. In other words, all complex numbers can be represented by these <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> real matrices <span class="math inline">\(a\mathbf{B}_{1}+b\mathbf{B}_{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <strong>determinant</strong> of real matrices <span class="math inline">\(a\mathbf{B}_{1}+b\mathbf{B}_{2}\)</span> corresponds to the squared <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">norm</a> (squared absolute value) <span class="math display">\[\mbox{det}(a\mathbf{B}_{1}+b\mathbf{B}_{2})=|a+\mbox{i}b|^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.\]</span> Thus, the multiplicative property of <span class="math inline">\(|z_{1}z_{2}|=|z_{1}||z_{2}|\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathbb{C}\)</span> can be deduced by the multiplicative property of <strong>determinants</strong> (fact 6).<label for="tufte-sn-224" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">224</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-224" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">224</span> The inverse <span class="math inline">\(z^{-1}=(a-\mbox{i}b)/(a^{2}+b^{2})\)</span>

\end{array}\right]^{-1}=\frac{1}{a^{2}+b^{2}}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
a &amp; b\\
-b &amp; a
\end{array}\right].\]</span></span></p>
<p>As we have seen the <strong>eigenvector and eigenvalues</strong> can present a linear transformation as a scalar multiplication, we may not be surprise by the fact that the polar form <span class="math inline">\(\cos\theta+\mbox{i}\sin\theta\)</span> is an eigenvalue of the rotation matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_{\theta}\)</span>. The determinant of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_{\theta}\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[

<p>A dynamical system of which the solution vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}(t)\)</span>
(continuous time) or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{t}\)</span> (discrete time) is changing with the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is not easy to be solved by the <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">Gaussian elimination</a>. In this type of problems, almost all vectors change “directions” over time, meanwhile the changes couple the vectors to evoke further variations. This is not a pleasant news to any attempt of exploring the unchanged property, say a dynamical law, in pratice. To a proper observer, the law should neither change with the <strong>coordinate system</strong> of the measurements nor evolve with any emerging tendency of the coupling system. Thus, a natural attempt of alleviating the difficulty is to model the dynamical law by a linear transformation<label for="tufte-sn-226" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">226</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-226" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">226</span> For non-linear events, one can linearize them locally. See Ch[?].</span>, and then to represent the linear transformation by the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">invariants</a>. <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">Eigen values-vectors</a> can - as long as the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigen values-vectors</a> are <strong>diagonalizable</strong> - provide us a perspective under which the vectors evolves seperately and the evolutions are along with their eigen-directions.</p>
<p>Let’s recall some properties of a <a href="l#sub:matInv">diagonal matrix</a>. Assume that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is a diagonal matrix such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=[a_{ij}]_{n\times n}=\mbox{diag}\{a_{11},\dots,a_{nn}\}\)</span>. It is easy to determine the output <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{b}\)</span> of the transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\)</span> because the transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> acts like <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> scalar multiplications by each <span class="math inline">\(a_{ii}\)</span> along the direction of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th entry of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. Normally, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is not a diagonal matrix, so each transformed entry (output) <span class="math inline">\(b_{i}\)</span> depends on some <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">linear combination</a> of the other entries. However, by using <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvector and eigenvalue</a>, we can find out under some eigenvector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, the transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{x}\)</span> act exactly as a scalar multiplication.

<p>Suppose that we find <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvectors</a> <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{v}_{i}\}_{i=1,\dots,n}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct real-valued eigenvalues, then the transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is decomposable into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> one-dimensional transformations acting along the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{v}_{n}\)</span> axes: <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1},\;\dots,\;\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}_{n}=\lambda_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n}.\]</span>
This result implies that given an indecomposable non-diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, it is possible to find new axes, along which the matrix behaves as diagonalizable one. The new axes, namely the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvectors</a> <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{n}\}\)</span> constructs a new coordinate system.<label for="tufte-sn-227" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">227</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-227" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">227</span> Formally speaking, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{v}_{n}\)</span> will construct a <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:vecSpaces">basis</a> in a finite dimensional vector space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{V}\)</span>.

<p>When the eigenvalues are complex numbers, the diagonalization still works, however it becomes difficult to represent in a 2D graph, as the transformation relating to the imaginary numbers is about the rotation, which cannot be decomposed in 1D.<label for="tufte-sn-229" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">229</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-229" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">229</span> As shown in section <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">12.1</a>, the rotation transformation has complex eigenvalues.

or say <span class="math display">\[c_{1}\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\lambda_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}+\cdots+c_{k}\lambda_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}=0.\]</span>
Subtract these two equations, we have<span class="math display">\[0\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2})\mathbf{v}_{2}+\cdots+c_{k}(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{k})\mathbf{v}_{k}=0\]</span> which is another linear combination but with fewer terms. This contradicts with the first linear combination.
Thus if there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-distinct eigenvectors, these eigenvectors must be <a href="#sub:vecSpace">linearly independent</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the columns of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> are linearly independent, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> is a full rank matrix and so it is invertible. We can have <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}=\Lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is <strong>similar</strong> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{T}=\mathbf{B}\)</span>, by definition and the trick <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{T}=\mathbf{I}\)</span>,
we have
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{B})=&amp;\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{T}-\mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{T})\\
=&amp;\mbox{det}(\mathbf{T}^{-1}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})\mathbf{T})\\
=&amp;\mbox{det}(\mathbf{T}^{-1})\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})\mbox{det}(\mathbf{T})\\
=&amp;\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}).
\end{align*}

<p>To see the use of <strong>diagonalization</strong> in dynamical systems, let’s recall that a matrix-vector multiplication can represent a dynamics of multiple inputs (see chapter <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">10.4</a>). In the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">discrete linear dynamical system</a>, with an initial vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{0}\)</span>, the linear transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_{1}=\mathbf{x}_{0}\)</span> evokes the system. The iteration <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_{t}=\mathbf{x}_{t-1}\)</span> can simulate the full set of dynamics of this system.</p>
<p>The computation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{t}\)</span> based on the initial vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{0}\)</span> requires <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> times iterations, namely <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{x}_{t}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_{t-1}=\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_{t-2})=\cdots=\mathbf{A}^{t}\mathbf{x}_{0}.\]</span>
To compute the power of matrices is not as simple as to compute the power of scalars.<label for="tufte-sn-231" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">231</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-231" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">231</span>  The issue is more serious if the power of matrices is used for linearization where a small perturbation may propogate unexpected chaotic consequences which makes the whole computational scheme fail. We will come to the topic of chaos in CH[?].</span>. However, to compute the power of diagonal matrices is simple. For example:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\Lambda^{k}&amp;=   \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}
\end{array}\right]\times\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}
\end{array}\right]\cdots\times\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}
\end{array}\right]\\
&amp;=  \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1}^{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}^{k}
\end{array}\right]=\mbox{diag}\{\lambda_{1}^{k},\dots,\lambda_{n}^{k}\}.
\end{align*}
\]</span>
Thus, if the matrix is <strong>diagonalizable</strong> with the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvector matrix</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> and the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvalue matrix</a> <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>, we may expect to have <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{A}^n = (\mathbf{V}^{-1}\Lambda\mathbf{V})^n=(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\Lambda\mathbf{V}\mathbf{V}^{-1}\Lambda\mathbf{V}\cdots\mathbf{V}^{-1}\Lambda\mathbf{V})=\mathbf{V}^{-1}\Lambda^n\mathbf{V}.\]</span> In this case, the advantage is clear: we need to calculate and apply the eigenvector matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\)</span> only once, and the rest of the iteration process is simply applying the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th power of the diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>Apart from the computational advantage, the <strong>diagonalization</strong> also assists us to disentangle some complex dynamical patterns of the <strong>coupled systems</strong>. In chapter <a href="sub-inferknow.html#sub:dyn">4.3</a> and <a href="ch-DE.html#sub:EulerScheme">8.2</a>, we have seen what a univariate (1D) time series is. The four possible dynmaical patterns of <span class="math inline">\(x_t = \lambda x_{t-1}\)</span> are summarized in figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:ts">12.9</a>.<label for="tufte-sn-232" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">232</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-232" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">232</span> The figure is designed for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{1,t}=0.8\mathbf{x}_{1,t-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{2,t}=1.02\mathbf{x}_{2,t-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{3,t}=-0.8\mathbf{x}_{3,t-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{4,t}=-1.02\mathbf{x}_{4,t-1}\)</span>.</span> We can see that the series converges if <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda|&lt;1\)</span> and diverges if <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda|&gt;1\)</span>. For negative <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the trends oscillate; for positive <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the trends are monotonic.</p>

<p>For a <span class="math inline">\(2\times2\)</span> diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, its linear dynamical system <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{t}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_{t-1}\)</span> only consists of two seperated univariate time series. This kind of system is called the <em>uncoupled system</em> where the growth of one series only depends on its own historical states. On the other hand, if the off-diagonal entries of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> are non-zero, then the dynamical system is a <em>coupled system</em>. The <strong>diagonalization</strong> allows us to analyze a <strong>coupled system</strong> in its <strong>uncoupling form</strong>.</p>
<p>Consider the following system
<span class="math display">\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1,t}\\
x_{2,t}
\end{array}\right]=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_{t-1}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0.65 &amp; 0.5\\
0.25 &amp; 0.9
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1,t-1}\\
x_{2,t-1}
\end{array}\right]
\]</span>
The eigenvalues of this system are <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{1}=1.15\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2}=0.4\)</span>. The eigenvectors can be chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}=[1,1]^{\top}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{2}=[-2,1]^{\top}\)</span>. Notice that the eigenvalues are real numbers and <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda_{1}|&gt;1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2}|&lt;1\)</span>. So for the <strong>uncoupled system</strong> <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{V}\mathbf{x}_{t})=\Lambda(\mathbf{V}\mathbf{x}_{t-1})\)</span>, we expect the behavior of the system must expand along the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}\)</span>-coordinate and contract along the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{2}\)</span>-coordinate. Figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:eigenDy1">12.10</a> shows that the initial vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{0}= [10,50]^{\top}\)</span> grows along the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}\)</span>-coordinate in five periods.</p>

<p>The eigenvalues of this system are <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{1}=0.9\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2}=-0.6\)</span>. The eigenvectors can be chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}=[1,1]^{\top}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{2}=[-2,1]^{\top}\)</span>. Figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:eigenDy2">12.11</a> shows that the trend shrinks along <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}\)</span> but collapse in an oscillating manner along the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{2}\)</span>-axis. The presence of oscillation is due to the negative eigenvalue which means that the matrix will flip the state point back and forth on either side of the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}\)</span>-axis. The oscillation is diminishing because the largest absolute eigenvalue is less than one (otherwise, the oscillation will departure).</p>

<p>The final case is that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_2\)</span> are a pair of <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">complex conjugate</a> eigenvalues, and then the action of the matrix was a rotation.

In figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:eigenDy3">12.12</a> we apply this transformation with an initial vector <span class="math inline">\([5,0]^{\top}\)</span>, the complex eigenvalues induces rotations to the system. Because the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\sin^2120^{\circ}+\cos^{2}120^{\circ}}=1\)</span>, these rotations neither expand nor shrink the sizes of the system.

<p>With above three examples, we can almost infer the following properties about the linear dynamical systems <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_t= \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}\)</span>.

If the eigenvalue has absolute value greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the matrix expands vectors lying along that eigenvector. If the eigenvalue is negative, the action of the matrix is to flip back and forth between negative and positive values along that eigenvector. If the eigenvalue is a complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">polar form</a> <span class="math inline">\(z=r\mbox{e}^{\mbox{i}\theta}\)</span> seperates the rotation <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{e}^{\mbox{i}\theta}\)</span> from the absolute size <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. In this case, the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> will indicate whether the matrix will shrink or will expand vectors, and <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{e}^{\mbox{i}\theta}\)</span> will rotate vectors around the axis of the complex-valued eigenvector.</p>
<p>Let’s define the <em>principal eigenvector</em> as the eigenvector whose eigenvalue has the largest absolute value. In the linear dynamical system, the state will evolve until its motion lies along the <strong>principal eigenvector</strong>. The largest eigenvalue, as the <em>principal eigenvalue</em> will determine the long-term behavior of the iteration, i.e. expansion, contraction, rotation, etc.</p>
<p>Recall that for a single <a href="#">differential equation</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{d}x(t)/\mbox{d}t=\lambda x(t)\)</span> with an initial value <span class="math inline">\(x(0)\)</span>, the solution is <span class="math inline">\(x(t)=x(0)\mbox{e}^{\lambda t}\)</span>. Similarly, for a linear system of <a href="ch-DE.html#sub:ode">differential equations</a>, the diagonal matrix uncouples the system. Let <span class="math display">\[\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mbox{d}v_{1}(t)/\mbox{d}t\\
\mbox{d}v_{2}(t)/\mbox{d}t
\end{array}\right]=\Lambda\mathbf{v}(t)=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda_{1} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \lambda_{2}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_{1}(t)\\
v_{2}(t)
\end{array}\right].\]</span>
Suppose the initial vector is <span class="math inline">\([v_{1}(0),v_{2}(0)]^{\top}\)</span>, the above system can be treated as two seperated differential equations whose solution vector is <span class="math display">\[\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_{1}(t)\\
v_{2}(t)
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
v_{1}(0)\mbox{e}^{\lambda_{1}t}\\
v_{2}(0)\mbox{e}^{\lambda_{2}t}
\end{array}\right],\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2}\)</span> play the roles of <a href="ch-DE.html#sub:ode">growth rates</a> for these differential equations.</p>
<p>Now we consider the third example of the linear dynamical system but under the continuous time setting. Let the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> be the <span class="math inline">\(120^{\circ}\)</span>-rotation matrix so that the system becomes:
<span class="math display">\[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\mbox{d}x_{1}(t)/\mbox{d}t\\
\mbox{d}x_{2}(t)/\mbox{d}t
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{2}(t)\\
-x_{1}(t)-x_{2}(t)
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; 1\\
-1 &amp; -1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}(t)\\
x_{2}(t)
\end{array}\right].
\]</span>
As we already knew the eigenvalues of this matrix are <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = -\frac{1}{2} \pm \mbox{i}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)</span>, we can infer the trends of this dynamical system. Notice that unlike in the discrete time setting, the solution vector contains <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{e}^{\lambda t}\)</span>, the exponential function of complex eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-233" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">233</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-233" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">233</span> This difference is due to the differential operator. In fact, we can extend the idea to general linear mappings or operators. Take the differential operator <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d}x}\)</span> (the operation of taking the derivative of a function) as an example. As the operation is linear, one may also expect there exist some “eigenvector” (or formally <em>eigenfunction</em>) of the operator. Let <span class="math inline">\(v(x)=\mbox{e}^{\lambda x}\)</span>. We know that <span class="math display">\[\frac{\mbox{d}}{\mbox{d}x}v(x)=\lambda v(x).\]</span> In other words, the exponential function <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{e}^{\lambda x}\)</span> is an eigenvector to the derivative-operator with eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. We will come back to this point in Ch[?].
.</span> The exponential function can be decomposed into two parts <span class="math display">\[\mbox{e}^{\lambda t}=\mbox{e}^{-\frac{t}{2}} \mbox{e}^{\pm \mbox{i}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t},\]</span>
a real exponential function and a pair of exponential functions with conjugate imaginary numbers. According to the previous discussion on convergences of differential equations in chapter <a href="ch-DE.html#sub:ode">8.1</a>, the real negative (positive) growth rate indicates the convergent (divergent) trend. Because the real parts of the eigenvalues are less than zero, we expect the system to converge. Because of the imaginary term <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{e}^{\pm \mbox{i}\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t}\)</span>, we also expect some rotations of <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2(t)\)</span> occuring in the process of convergence. In figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:odeEuler">12.13</a>, we can find that both solutions converge to zero. The convergence accompanies with some oscillationary movements across time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The oscillation is caused by the rotation. Because the rotation (of a 2D circle) means the loss or the gain in one direction is partially compensated by the gain or the loss from the other. This rotation together with the convergent treand appears as a stable spiral in figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:odeSys">12.14</a>. Figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:odeSys">12.14</a> provides a coordinate plane with axes being the values of two state variables <span class="math inline">\(x_1(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2(t)\)</span>. This kind of plots is called the <em>phase plot</em>.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> * Miscellaneous: Alchemy and Values</h2>
<p>Alchemy is about an idea of a common metallic matter subject to interchangeable sets of qualities. The common metallic matter in the west was called Philosophers’ stone, and in the east was called Golden elixir. They both reveal an ideal capability of transforming substances. While Philosophers’ stone is supposed to transform the substances into better ones, the Golden exlixir is supposed to transform the substances into immortal ones. In history, legions of alchemists sought for these stones to transform coloring metals, stones, and cloth into precious (or apparently precious) objects.</p>
<p>Transformation, as an alchemical theme here, obeys a cosmic view of the world that all substances are composed of the same fundamental one. If a single material that serves as the fundamental for all substances, one may expect to turn one thing into another because at the deepest level they are really the same thing. In Greek philosophy, this idea is the <em>ladder of nature</em>: everything in existence, from inanimate matter to the transcendent one, is linked in a hierarchical chain. In Chinese philosophy, this idea is called the <em>correlative cosmology</em> (天人合一): all entities and phenomena ultimately originate from the Dao (道) in a hierarchical manner.<label for="tufte-sn-234" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">234</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-234" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">234</span> This idea later was developped into a doctrine called <em>interactions between heaven and mankind</em> (天人感应) by the confucian politician Dong Zhongshu. The doctrine approached within the ace of the Christian faith where the omniscience of God implied that a uniform, harmonious, interfunctioning world, namely a highly ordered and self-consistent whole. It not only served as a basis for deciding the legitimacy of Chinese monarch but also provided governing guidances on a reigning monarch.</span> These principles undergirded the idea of alchemical transmutation, and encourged alchmists to explore the theoretical possibility of transforming unessential substances into more valuable ones.</p>
<p>From my current point of view, the literature about alchemy consists of a forbidding tangle of intentional secrecy, bizarre ideas, and strange images plunging the readers into a maze of conflicting claims and contradictory assertions. Thus, my motivation is not to provide any serious knowledge about the secrets, the processes or the privileges of alchemy, as I think the comprehensive root of the subject has been merged into modern chemistry. Instead, I will treat the alchemy as a kind of exploration of the nature of matter under the themes of purification and improvement. And by giving a brief retrospective description of this exploration, I will provide a coarse outline of defining the value (of transformations) from an alchemical perspective.</p>
<p>Alchemy, like other sceintific pursuits, has a skeleton of theory that provides intellectual fundamentals, that instructs the practical works, and illuminates the perspicuous pathways of future developments. Ancient Greek philosophers (Empedocles and later Aristotle) attributed the origin of natural substances and their transformations to four “roots” of things which are fire, air, earth, and water. Similarly, ancient Chinese philosophers attributed the essence, namely the set of properties constructing substances, to five elements which are earth, metal, water, wood, and fire. Both schools of thoughts endeavored to explain matter’s hidden nature and to account for its unending transformations into new forms. Most of the following ideas point to the belief that some sort of an invariant hidden beneath the constantly changing appearances of things. The invariant of Thales was water, of Aristotle was the first matter, of Empedocles were four elements, of Daoists and Confucianists were five elements.</p>
<p>Just like any current empirical research activities, alchemists relied on those theoretical principles to guide the practical work. The practice of transformative process could involve special psychic states and incorporeal agents. The history of alchemy were simultaneously chemical, spiritual, and psychological, but that the main purpose of those pratical works looked like to unite the several constituents of consciousness and to develop a trascending state of mankind. At this point, we can see a clear bifurcation of two schools.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Judaic-Christian alchemy: The Philosophers’ stone as a perfect metal represents the state of quintessence for transforming corrodible base metals into incorruptible gold.<label for="tufte-sn-235" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">235</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-235" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">235</span> The metals were divided into different categories. By the standards of the intrinsic beauty and the ability to resist corrosion, noble metals (such as gold and silver) are different from the base metals (such as copper, iron, tin, lead, and mercury).</span></p></li>
<li><p>Chinese alchemy: The Golden elixir as a immortal pellet represents the state of constancy and immutability beyond the change and transiency.<label for="tufte-sn-236" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">236</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-236" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">236</span> In Chinese history, Sulphur and nitre were both used for medicinal purposes to extend the life of a person, and for military purposes to extend the life of the culture.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the ultimal goals looked different, if we interpret the chemical processes declared by the alchemists as metaphorical or analogical manifestations of the need for enhancing knowledge to achieve salvation, of the need for distilling human’s inner being to archieve divinity, we may consider what all these alchemists sought were the same, a purely self-transformative, meditative, psychic process.<label for="tufte-sn-237" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">237</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-237" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">237</span> <span class="citation">Jung (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Jung2008">2008</a>)</span> asserted that the real object of alchemy was the transformation of the psyche, and considered Alchemy’s “true root” was to be found not so much in philosophical ideas and outlooks but rather in “experiences of projection of the individual researcher.” <span class="citation">Jung (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Jung2008">2008</a>)</span> say,
“a peculiar attitude of the mind—the concentration of attention on a single thing. The result of this state of concentration is that the mind is absorbed to the exclusion of other things, and to such a degree insensible that the way is opened for automatic actions; and these actions, becoming more complicated, as in the preceding case, may assume a psychic character and constitute intelligences of a parasitic kind, existing side by side with the normal personality, which is not aware of them.” Since the psyche could project its contents onto any sort of matter, the actual substances employed by the alchemist were not crucial. Jung believe that Alchemy’s allegorical language were expressions of a collective unconscious.</span></p>
<p>Transformation, in a alchemical metaphor, could be about the changes of the non-volatile body and the volatile spirit. The body seems to be the same for all substances; so the identity is dependent on its spirit.</p>
<p>The Judaism-Christian alchemy focused on a transformation from a state of nature to a state of grace by releasing the imprisoned material body. Themes such as purification and distillation readily lend themselves as moral or spiritual symbols. Knowledge, in this case, was necessary to overcome one’s ignorance, to liberate oneself from the material world and the evil forces.</p>
<p>The Chinese alchemy focused on a transformation from a fleeting state to an eternal state by collecting the seperated spirits. Metaphorical sublimation and volatilization seperated the spirits from the various bodies. Joining the separated temporary spirits formed a unified long-lived consciousness, and established the desired collective knowledge.</p>
<p>All these alchemical reactions nowadays were thought to be chemical related reactions. It may be interesting to know that an overall chemical reaction consists of a finite number of individual reaction steps that can be represented by a matrix equation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=0\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=[a_{ij}]_{n\times m}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> stands for the number of different chemical species, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> stands for the number of different reactions, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}=[x_{j}]_{m\times1}\)</span> represents the concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> chemical species. The matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is called the <em>stoichiometric matrix</em> that shows certain <a href="#sub:vector">linear combinations</a> of concentrations.<label for="tufte-sn-238" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">238</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-238" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">238</span> An <strong>stoichiometric equation</strong> comes with a reaction arrow, left of which gives the substances with negative stoichiometric coefficients (reactants), and right of which gives the substances with positive stoichiometric coefficients (products). For example a chemical reaction <span class="math inline">\(x_{1}+3x_{2}\rightarrow2x_{3}\)</span> is represented by <span class="math inline">\(-x_{1}-3x_{2}+2x_{3}=0\)</span>. The theory of this model is known as the chemical reaction network theory. </span> Then the same <strong>stoichiometric matrix</strong> can describe the dynamical changes of a system of elementary reactions in a system of differential equations, such as <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{d}\mathbf{x}(t)/\mbox{d}t=\mathbf{A}f(\mathbf{x}(t))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> is a function about the rate of reactions.<label for="tufte-sn-239" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">239</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-239" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">239</span> Usually, the function <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> adheres to a power law of the kinetic energy, which means that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_{i})\)</span> is obtained by multiplying the concentrations raised to a suitable power (a <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">monomial</a>), i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f(x_{i})=c_{i}\prod_{k=1}^{m}x_{k}^{\beta_{j,k}}\)</span>. Then one can have a <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">multivariate polynomial</a> where the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-entry of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}f(\mathbf{x}(t))\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}c_{i}\prod_{k=1}^{m}x_{k}^{\beta_{j,k}}\)</span>. The equations <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}f(\mathbf{x}(t))\)</span> typically preserve the <a href="#sub:ODE">autonomous property</a> of differential equations. A reaction step with this power law can be written as the following chemical equation: <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j=1}^{m}\beta_{ij}x_{j}\rightarrow\sum_{j=1}^{m}(\beta_{ij}+a_{ij})x_{j}\)</span>.</span></p>

<span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> Example: Matrix Norm, Changes of Basis, Autoregressive Model, Trade Flows</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">Matrix norm </span></p>
<p>The concept of a <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">vector norm</a> gives us a way of thinking about the “size” of a vector. We could easily extend this to matrices, just by thinking of a matrix as a vector that had been chopped into segments of equal length and then re-stacked as a matrix. Thus, every vector norm on the space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\)</span> of vectors of length <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> gives rise to a vector norm on the space of <span class="math inline">\(m\times n\)</span> matrices. Since the abosulte value of the eigenvalue is a real number, a nautral idea is to let the eigenvalue serve the role as a matrix norm. Unfortunately, the experience has shown that this is not the best way to look for norms of matrices because of the operation of matrix multiplication. In a matrix-vecotr multiplication, a matrix linearly transforming a vector into another one can rescale the norms of these vectors. By taking the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">vector norms</a> of the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition</a> <span class="math inline">\(\|\mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} \| = \|\lambda \mathbf{v}\|\)</span>, we can see that given <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, the absolute value <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda| = \| \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} \|/ \| \mathbf{v} \|\)</span> varies with the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> (see figure <a href="ch-eigen.html#fig:eigenval">12.7</a>).</p>
<p>The reason is that any <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">linear combination</a> of eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> can provide a corresponding eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Then, there could be infinite absolute <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>s of a matix transformation, while the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">norm</a> is a function whose output is set to a single <a href="sub-continuity.html#sub:completeness">real-valued number</a>. Fortunately, for any set of real numbers, by the <a href="sub-continuity.html#sub:completeness">axiom of completeness</a> of real numbers, such a set is bounded above and has a <a href="sub-continuity.html#sub:completeness">supremum</a>. Thus, we need to take the <a href="sub-continuity.html#sub:completeness">supremum</a> of all possible real-valued <span class="math inline">\(|\lambda|\)</span>s to attain a unique output. Here is a usual definition of the <em>(strong) matrix norm</em><label for="tufte-sn-240" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">240</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-240" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">240</span> Similarly, as the <a href="l#sub:vecSpaces">operator</a> is the counterpart of a matix in the finite dimension, the <em>norm of the operator</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{A}}\)</span> can be induced by the matrix norm such that <span class="math display">\[\|\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{A}}\|=\sup_{\mathbf{x}\neq0}\frac{\|\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{x})\|}{\|\mathbf{x}\|}.\]</span></span>: <span class="math display">\[\|\mathbf{A}\|=\sup_{\mathbf{x}\neq0}\frac{\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\|}{\|\mathbf{x}\|}.\]</span></p>

<p>Recall that the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:diag">diagonalization</a> of an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> square matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:diag">similar</a> to the diagonal eigenvalue matrix <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda=\mbox{diag}\{\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n}\}\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}=\Lambda\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{V}\Lambda\mathbf{V}^{-1}.\)</span> If another matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> is <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:diag">similar</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, say <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{A}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X}^{-1}\)</span>, then it is easy to see that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> have the same <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvalues</a> and the same <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">characteristic polynomial</a>.<label for="tufte-sn-241" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">241</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-241" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">241</span>  By properties of <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">determinants</a> and the trick <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{I}\)</span>, we have
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A})&amp;=\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{X}^{-1}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{X}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{X})\\&amp;=\mbox{det}(\mathbf{X}^{-1}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{B})\mathbf{X})\\
&amp;=\mbox{det}(\mathbf{X}^{-1})\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{B})\mbox{det}(\mathbf{X})\\&amp;=\mbox{det}(\lambda\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{B}).
\end{align*}
\]</span>
So the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">characteristic polynomials</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> are the same.</span>
In this case, we have
<span class="math display">\[\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X}^{-1}=(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{V})\Lambda(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{-1})=(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{V})\Lambda(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{V})^{-1},\]</span>
where the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> is viewed as <em>a change of basis matrix</em> from the basis of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span>, to another basis of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{V}\)</span>.
Any linear operation of changing basis follows this idea of preserving the invariant eigenvalues.</p>
<p>To generalize this idea, we can change the basis of two polynomial matices. First, we show that when a matrix is mapped by a polynomial function, the eigenvalue matrix is simultaneously mapped by the same function.
Let <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=c_{0}+c_{1}z+\cdots+c_{n}z^{n}\)</span> be a polynomial function, it is easy to see that when the input is a diagonal matrix, the function <span class="math inline">\(f(\Lambda)\)</span> is another diagonal matrix with entries as polynomials such that <span class="math inline">\(f(\Lambda)=\mbox{diag}\{f(\lambda_{1}),\dots,f(\lambda_{n})\}\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-242" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">242</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-242" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">242</span> Functions like <span class="math inline">\(\sin(\cdot)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\cos(\cdot)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{e}^{(\cdot)}\)</span>, which do not appear as polynomials but can be defined in terms of <a href="sub-calculus.html#sub:Taylor">power series</a> (the infinite version of a polynomial function) can also have such property.</span></p>
<p>To see this argument, we know that <span class="math display">\[f(\Lambda)=c_{0}\mathbf{I}+c_{1}\Lambda+\cdots+c_{n}\Lambda^{n}.\]</span> Each monomial <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda^{k}\)</span>
has the following expression
<span class="math display">\[\Lambda^{k}
=   \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1}^{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}^{k}
\end{array}\right]=\mbox{diag}\{\lambda_{1}^{k},\dots,\lambda_{n}^{k}\}.\]</span>
So adding up all the monomials gives
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
f(\Lambda) &amp;=   c_{0}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right]+c_{1}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}
\end{array}\right]+\cdots+c_{n}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1}^{n} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{n}^{n}
\end{array}\right] \\
&amp;=  \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
c_{0}+c_{1}\lambda_{1}+\cdots c_{n}\lambda_{1}^{n} &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_{0}+c_{1}\lambda_{n}+\cdots+c_{n}\lambda_{n}^{n}
\end{array}\right]\\
&amp;=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
f(\lambda_{1}) &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 &amp; \ddots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; f(\lambda_{n})
\end{array}\right].
\end{align*}
\]</span>
When <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> is <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:diag">diagonalizable</a> as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}=\Lambda\)</span>, for any monomial <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda^{k}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(f(\Lambda)\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[\Lambda^{k}=(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V})(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V})\cdots(\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V})=\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{A}^{k}\mathbf{V}.\]</span>
The <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition</a> becomes <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{V}=f(\Lambda)\mathbf{V}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}^{-1}f(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{V}=f(\Lambda)\)</span> because
<span class="math display">\[f(\Lambda)=c_{0}+c_{1}\Lambda+\cdots+c_{n}\Lambda^{n}=\mathbf{V}^{-1}(c_{0}+c_{1}\mathbf{A}+\cdots+\mathbf{A}^{n})\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{V}^{-1}f(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{V}.\]</span>
In other words, the diagonalization of the polynomial matrix <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{A})\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[f(\Lambda)=\mathbf{V}^{-1}f(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{V}.\]</span>
Therefore, if <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}\)</span> is <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">similar</a> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{A}\)</span>, we can induce that for any polynomial function <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{B})\)</span> is similar to <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{A})\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}^{-1}f(\mathbf{B})\mathbf{X}=f(\mathbf{A})\)</span>.
The change of basis follows the same structure:
<span class="math display">\[f(\mathbf{B})=\mathbf{X}f(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{X}^{-1}=(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{V})f(\Lambda)(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{V})^{-1}.\]</span></p>
<p>In addition, the basis <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> can also be interchanged with each other. Consider an example in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{2}\)</span>. For two <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">coordinate systems</a>, say <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\}\)</span>, there must exist a <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:vec">linear combination</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_{2}\)</span> for representing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{1}\)</span> under the <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\}\)</span>-coordinate, so does for representing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{2}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{x}_{1} &amp;=   c_{11}\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{21}\mathbf{v}_{2}\\
\mathbf{x}_{2} &amp;=   c_{12}\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{22}\mathbf{v}_{2}.
\end{align*}
\]</span>
In other words,<span class="math display">\[[\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2}]=[\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
c_{11} &amp; c_{12}\\

<p>In the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearity">linear regression</a> example in chapter <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearity">10.2</a>, we have seen the way of finding a linear relation between a data vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y} = \hat{\beta}\mathbf{x}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> is the estimator given by the <a href="#sub:Vector">projection formula</a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s switch our attention to some real dynamical data (time series data), and we can find that this regressive idea still works. The idea of autoregression is about regressing a data vector on itself. Consider one time series <span class="math inline">\(\{x_{t}\}_{t=1,\dots,T}\)</span> as a vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T}=[x_{1},\dots,x_{T}]^{\top}\)</span>.
we can shift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T-1}=[0,x_{2},\dots,x_{T-1}]^{\top}\)</span> by using a <em>lagged operation matrix</em> (a <a href="ch-MatComp.html#sub:GElimination">lower triangular elementary matrix</a>) <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{L}\)</span> such that
<span class="math display">\[\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}_{T}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots\\

x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\

x_{T}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
x_{1}\\
\vdots\\
x_{T-1}
\end{array}\right]=\mathbf{x}_{T-1}.\]</span></p>
<p>We call <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T-1}\)</span> the <em>lagged vector</em> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span>. Then a difference equation <span class="math inline">\(x_{t}=\phi x_{t-1}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t=1,\dots T\)</span> can be expressed by a single relation between the data vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span> and its <strong>lagged vector</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T-1}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T}=\phi\mathbf{x}_{T-1}=\phi\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span>

<p>The previous regression model uses one <strong>lagged vector</strong>, so it is often called an AR(1) (<em>autoregressive model with one lagged variable</em>). By multiplying the <strong>lagged operation matrix</strong> <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-times, one can shift <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_{T-k}=[0,\dots,x_{1},\dots,x_{T-k}]^{\top}\)</span>. So if one prefers to consider some relation depending on the longer historical information, one can regress on other lagged data vectors. For example, the relation <span class="math display">\[x_{t}=\phi_{1}x_{t-1}+\phi_{2}x_{t-2}\]</span> can induce an AR(2) model. However, it may be not so obvious to judge the dynamical pattern for this AR(2) model, as the eigenvalues of this model relate to the solution of a second order polynomial equation. To see this, we rewrite the relation of AR(2) as <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{x}_{T}-\phi_{1}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}_{T}-\phi_{2}\mathbf{L}^{2}\mathbf{x}_{T}=f(\mathbf{L})\mathbf{x}_{T}=0\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{L})=1-\phi_{1}\mathbf{L}-\phi_{2}\mathbf{L}^{2}\)</span>. The <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigen decomposition</a> gives <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{L})\mathbf{x}_{T}=f(\Lambda)\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda=\mbox{diag}\{\lambda_1,\lambda_2\}\)</span> is the eigenvalue matrix. The polynomial equation <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{L})=0\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(f(\Lambda)=0\)</span> or say <span class="math inline">\(f(\Lambda)=\mbox{diag}\{f(\lambda_{1}), f(\lambda_{2})\}=0.\)</span> Because the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> asserts that the polynomial equation <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=0\)</span> has two roots on the complex field, we can infer that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_2\)</span> are these roots. That is to say, the second order polynomial equation can be factorized by two first order polynomial equations:<label for="tufte-sn-244" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">244</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-244" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">244</span> The <em>factor theorem of polynomials</em> asserts that a polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> order can be written as a product of two or more polynomials of degrees less than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2}\)</span> are two distinct roots of a second order polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> can be factorized as <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=c_{0}(z-\lambda_{1})(z-\lambda_{2})\)</span>. For the equation <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c_{0}\)</span> does not matter, so we have <span class="math inline">\((z-\lambda_{1})(z-\lambda_{2})=0\)</span>.</span> <span class="math display">\[f(\mathbf{L})=(\mathbf{L} - \lambda_1)(\mathbf{L}-\lambda_2)=0,\]</span> which implies that the AR(2) model <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{L})\mathbf{x}_T = 0\)</span> is equivalent to a system of two AR(1) models: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{1}\mathbf{x}_{T}=\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{2}\mathbf{x}_{T}=\mathbf{L}\mathbf{x}_{T}\)</span>. As we have seen in section <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:diag">12.2</a>, the property of such a dynamical system is controlled by the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:diag">principal eigenvalue</a>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\max\{|\lambda_{1}|,|\lambda_{2}|\}\)</span>. Similar to the AR(1) case, in order to have a converging (diverging) pattern, the principal eigenvalue of the lagged operation matrices needs to be greater than (less than) one, namely <span class="math inline">\(\max\{|\lambda_{1}|,|\lambda_{2}|\}&gt;1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\max\{|\lambda_{1}|,|\lambda_{2}|\}&lt;1\)</span>).</p>

<p>Recall that the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">directed networks</a> in chapter <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">10.4</a> can record the direction of the connections amongst the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">vertices</a>. Assume that across each edge of this directed network, something flows. This something could be loans (for a network of banks), could be a current (for a network of a circuit), or could be monetary transactions (for a network of international trades). As each network can be denoted by an <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">adjacency matrix</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}=[a_{ij}]_{n\times n }\)</span>, one can let the non-zero entry <span class="math inline">\(a_{ij}\)</span> in the matrix denote the flows from the vertex <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>The following data table gives a sample of the international trade flows data.</p>

<p>In social phenomena, certain network vertices form more efficient linkages than the others. The structure of such networks often consists of strong ties of interactions between some center <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">vertices</a> and many relatively isolated <a href="#sub:linearSy">vertices</a>. This phenomenon is called <em>centrality</em> in network analysis. More specifically, the more a vertex is connected to highly connected vertices, the stronger its centrality. In other words, more connections and more flows seem to endow more power.</p>

<p><a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">Eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition</a> of the <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">adjancy matrix</a> can show the <strong>centrality</strong> in a way that vertices are arranged in a hierarchical relation to specific eigenvector positions. Simiarly to the example of ranking the pages (see chapter <a href="ch-vecMat.html#sub:linearSys">10.4</a>), we can count the total importing trade flows of each country and then rank the countries according to the counting score. Let <span class="math inline">\(x_{i}\)</span> be the counting score of the country <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We define <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> as the sum of all the exporting trades multiplying the scores of the corresponding importers: <span class="math display">\[x_{i}=\sum_{j}a_{i,j}x_{j},\:\mbox{or say }\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}.\]</span>
It is obvious to see that the score vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> is the <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvector</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{A}\)</span> whose associated <a href="ch-eigen.html#sub:det">eigenvalue</a> is one. In addition, the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th entry of the <a href="#sub:Det">eigenvector</a> represents the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th country’s trading strength in this international trade flows data.</p>
