<span class="header-section-number">1</span> Logic</h1>
<p>The power of knowledge is that it can infer movements in both the natural and the social world<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> The inference can even become part of the movements if were it invented for interventing or intensifying the movements.</span>. What is an <em>inference</em>? It is a sequence of logical reasonings that show how a new fact, called a <em>conclusion</em> in logic, can be derived from a set of known facts, called <em>premises</em> or <em>hypothesis</em> in logic. Understanding inference comes from actually understanding the logic and the mechanics of logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Philosophy brings logic in our reasoning languages. Logical reasoning has its fundamental importance in language communications and mathematics, and also in their combined field of computer programming languages where logic dominates. Logical reasoning is the process of <strong>concluding</strong> from <strong>premises</strong> using <strong>rules of inference</strong>. The <em>reasoning</em> is formally called <strong>inference</strong> in logic. Logic gives a system for mechanical reasoning. That is a system where the <strong>premises</strong> are in neutral symbolic forms and where one can use these forms to determine whether or not the <strong>conclusions</strong> drawn from the premises are valid.</p>
<p>Logic consists of three parts: <strong>syntax</strong>, <strong>semantics</strong>, and a set of <strong>inference rules</strong>. A logic’s <em>syntax</em> tells you, formally, how to read and write sentences in that logic. The meaning of these sentences is called <em>semantics</em>. <em>Inference rules</em> are the results of observations of human reasoning over centuries. These rules are often called <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">laws of thought</a>. They give a way of taking what you know and using it to prove new facts. Logic is a name for the general family of formal proof systems with <strong>inference rules</strong>.</p>
<p>Logic has a wide variety. Each logic is designed for a purpose, to do a particular kind of reasoning or inference. You need to know what <a href="sub-axioms.html#sub:axioms">axioms</a> (basic facts) to use in the reasoning and how your logic allows you to complete your reasoning.<label for="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">2</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">2</span> The most commonly used logic for deducing truth or falsehood in a sentence is the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">zeroth-order logic</a> (or called <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">propositional logic</a>), while for inferences, the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">first-order predicate</a> logic is more powerful.</span></p>
<div id="sub:zeroth" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Laws of Thought and Zeroth-order Logic</h2>
<p>The <em>laws of thought</em> are fundamental basic rules that build the logic system. We can treat these laws as some rational summaries of the common senses that guide and underlie everyone’s thinking, thoughts, expressions, discussions, etc. For <strong>zeroth-order logic</strong> and <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">first-order predicate logic</a><label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span>  Zeroth-order logic is <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">first-order logic</a> without <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">predicates</a>. <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">First-order predicate</a> logic is symbolized reasoning in which each sentence is broken down into <strong>qualitifiers</strong> and <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">predicates</a>. See section <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:1order">1.3</a>.</span>, the laws of though only need two principles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Principle of contradiction</em> (principium contradictionis): a <strong>sentence</strong> (or formally, a <strong>proposition</strong>) is never true and false at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Principle of the excluded third</em> (tertium non datur): a <strong>sentence</strong> (or a <strong>proposition</strong>) is either true or false - there is no third possibility.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When a logic system satisfies only these two principles, any sentence in this logic is either true (<span class="math inline">\(\mbox{T}\)</span>) or false (<span class="math inline">\(\mbox{F}\)</span>). For zeroth-order logic, some <strong>operational syntaxes</strong> (<em>qualitfier</em>) are used to create new propositions from old ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Logical negation</em>: <strong>NOT</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\lnot\)</span>). The negation of a true sentence is a false one and vice versa, <span class="math inline">\(\lnot\mbox{T}=\mbox{F}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot\mbox{F}=\mbox{T}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Logical conjunction</em>: <strong>AND</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>). The conjunction of two sentences is true if and only if both sentences are true, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{T}\vee\mbox{T}=\mbox{T}\)</span>. It also means <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{F}\vee\mbox{T}=\mbox{T}\vee\mbox{F}=\mbox{F}\vee\mbox{F}=\mbox{F}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Logical disjunction</em>: <strong>OR</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\land\)</span>). The disjunction of two sentences is true if at least one of them is true, <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{F}\land\mbox{T}=\mbox{T}\land\mbox{F}=\mbox{T}\land\mbox{T}=\mbox{T}\)</span>. Otherwise, the disjunction is false.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the common language, we say, “The sun is red” and “The sea is blue.” In zeroth-order logic, the sentence “The sun is red” is simply the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:logic">semantics</a>, and it can be abbreviated in a letter <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Similarly, “The sea is blue” can be written as a letter <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Both <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> represent a <strong>sentence</strong>. Let’s assume that both of them are true, namely <span class="math inline">\(R=\mbox{T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B=\mbox{T}\)</span>. So we can make such simple reasoning that the sentence “The sun is red and the sea is blue” must be true as <span class="math inline">\(R\vee B=\mbox{T}\vee\mbox{T}=\mbox{T}\)</span> according to the <strong>logical conjunction</strong>.</p>
<p>The most fundamental <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:logic">inference rule</a> in zeroth-order, and later in first-order predicate logic, is the <strong>logical implication</strong> or called modus ponens. It allows us to identify the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:logic">premise</a> and the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:logic">conclusion</a>. It is often easier to deal with an implication when it is expressed in an “if, then” form. In addition, the phrase “if and only if” (iff) is also quite useful, as it is the logical version of equality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Logical implication</em>: <strong>IF-THEN</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>). Sentence <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> implies sentence <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(A\Rightarrow B\)</span>. It means is that if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is true, then <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> must also be true so that <span class="math inline">\(A\Rightarrow B\)</span> is true. The implication <span class="math inline">\(A\Rightarrow B\)</span> is false only when <span class="math inline">\(A=\mbox{T}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B=\mbox{F}\)</span>.<label for="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">4</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">4</span> Notice that if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is false and whenever <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is false or true, the implication <span class="math inline">\(A\Rightarrow B\)</span> is true. Because the fact that a <strong>wrong</strong> premise may imply a wrong or a true conclusion is true.</span></p></li>
<li><p><em>Logical bicondition</em>: <strong>IFF</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span>). <span class="math inline">\(A\Leftrightarrow B\)</span> is the logical conjunction of the implication <span class="math inline">\(A\Rightarrow B\)</span> and the converse <span class="math inline">\(B\Rightarrow A\)</span> It means <span class="math inline">\(A\Leftrightarrow B\)</span> is true whenever the sentences <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are both true or are both false.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We sometimes refer the symbols <span class="math inline">\(\lnot\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\land\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span> as <em>logical connectives</em>. The connectives give us the ability to form all of the basic logical statements.</p>
</div>
<div id="sub:ex-computer" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Example: Computer and Boolean Algebra</h2>
<p>The invention of the computer relates to the intention of finding a way to simulate the rational human brain that can execute logical thinking. <span class="citation">Boole (<a href="bibliography.html#ref-Boole1854">1854</a>)</span>, in his book of laws of thought, suggested an algebra system in which logic can be represented by mathematics. With this kind of algebra, he indicated that it is possible to have a mathematical description of how the brain works. The current computer realizes some of his ambitions.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the realization of Boole’s suggestion. If we assign number <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to True (<span class="math inline">\(\mbox{T}\)</span>) and number <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to False (<span class="math inline">\(\mbox{F}\)</span>), by the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">principle of contradiction</a> and <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">principle of the excluded third</a>, we know that any sentence will be assigned a value of either <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. For the logical conjunction AND (<span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>) with <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{T}=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{F}=0\)</span>, there is <span class="math display">\[0\vee0=0,\:0\vee1=0,\,1\vee0=0,\,1\vee1=1.\]</span> The role of <span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> here is very similar to the role of the multiplication operator <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>. If you replace <span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>, the results above still hold. Similarly, for the logical disjunction OR (<span class="math inline">\(\land\)</span>), there is <span class="math display">\[0\land0=0,\:0\land1=1,\,1\land0=1,\,1\land1=1.\]</span>
The above results are almost the same as those of regular addition <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span>, except the last case, which now implies <span class="math inline">\(1+1\neq2\)</span>. That is because <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is not defined in this algebra system (<a href="sub:zeroth">principle of the excluded third</a>).</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>This algebra system can be implemented in an electric circuit. Two switches, “off” and “on”, represent binary values <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Then the logical operators come with the structure of the circuit. For example, if you connect a lightbulb and battery by using two switches. When these two switches are connected one right after the other, namely in series, the circuit will perform exactly as <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">logical conjunction AND</a>. The lightbulb only lights up, which means the result is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, when you open both switches, like <span class="math inline">\(1\times1=1\)</span>. In the case that only one switch is opened or both are closed, the lightbulb will stay off, like <span class="math inline">\(1\times0=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(0\times0=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>

<!--</div>--></span>
</p>
<p>Similarly, when two switches are in parallel, the circuit will perform exactly as the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">logical disjunction OR</a>. Thus, these circuits realize the basic operations in <em>Boolean algebra</em>. With this algebra and the development of electrical circuitry, the computer finally appeared.</p>

<div id="sub:1order" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> First-order Predicate Logic</h2>
<p>If our goal is to seek the truth, then we need to connect many pieces of <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:logic">premises</a> and to use them to prove the <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:logic">conclusion</a>. <a href="sub-logic.html#sub:zeroth">Zeroth-order logic</a> is not powerful enough to represent all types of useful assertions or to express certain types of relationships between sentences such as equivalence. To cope with deficiencies of <a href="#sub:Zeroth">zeroth-order logic</a>, we need two new features: <strong>predicates</strong> and <strong>quantifiers</strong>. A <strong>predicate</strong> is a sort of like a function that describes properties of objects or relationships between objects. <strong>Quantifiers</strong> let you limit the statement to a particular set of objects instead of allowing ambiguous objects. These two features become important when the sentences containing variables<label for="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">5</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">5</span> Constants represent objects in the domain of interest, such as a number or a value about which we can reason by using the logic. Variables, on the other hand, range over the objects in the domain.</span> because the truth or falseness of the sentences is only known when the variables obtain the assigned values.</p>
<p>We know that the sentence “The sun is red” can be written as <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Previously, we assume that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is true. This assumption, however, is not quite precise. The sun is red in the daytime, but it can be pink during the dawn, or purple during the sunset or even grey in the cloud. To avoid these worries, we can modify the sentences into “(The sun during the daytime) is red” to assure the sentence still true. Notice that if we change the statement (The sun during the daytime) into (The sun during the sunset), then the sentence becomes false. The phrase in the brackets is a variable. We can write the previous sentence as <span class="math inline">\(R(x)\)</span>. When the <strong>variable</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the phrase “The sun in the daytime”, then <span class="math inline">\(R(x)\)</span> is true. Here <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> represents the predicate “is red”, and <span class="math inline">\(R(x)\)</span> reads as “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is red”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Predicate</em>: A verb phrase template that describes a property of objects, or a relationship among objects represented by the variables.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Universal quantification</em>: <strong>ANY</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\forall\)</span>). Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a sentence, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a variable of this sentence, then the expression <span class="math inline">\(\forall x:\: S(x)\)</span> means that the predicate <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\)</span> is true for all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Existential quantification</em>: <strong>EX</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\exists\)</span>). Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a variable, and <span class="math inline">\(S(a)\)</span> is true when <span class="math inline">\(x=a\)</span>. The expression <span class="math inline">\(\exists x:\, S(x)\)</span> means that there is at least one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\)</span> is true.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A predicate with variables is not a sentence. For example, the statement <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;2\)</span> with variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> over the natural numbers is neither true nor false since we don’t know what <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is. It can be true or false, depending on the value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. A predicate becomes a simple fact or a simple sentence only when its variable values are filled.</p>
<p>With these logical features, the first-order predicate logic has been endowed an ability to prove things. Proof in logic is done by inference because inference gives you a way of using what you know to prove new facts. Almost all important inferences outside logic and mathematics are induction. In computer science and mathematics, the common inference rule is <a href="sub:1order">mathematical induction</a><label for="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">6</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">6</span> The proof given by mathematical induction is, in fact, about deductive reasoning. Although it is called mathematical induction, the implication (<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>)
is a deductive rule of inference.</span>. The <em>mathematical induction</em> includes two steps. The first step, or the basic step, is to prove the property holds for the initial value. The second step, or the induction step, is to prove that the same property holds for arbitrary sequential values. The simplest form of mathematical induction is used for inferring a statement involving natural numbers.</p>
</div>
<div id="sub:PeanoInd" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Example: Peano’s Induction Rule</h2>
<p><em>Natural numbers</em> <span class="math inline">\(0,1,2,3,\dots\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, are the fundamentals because, for the current computer, any computable thing ultimately comes from the <strong>natural numbers</strong>. Also, the natural number system is almost the simplest and most familiar number system. Natural numbers’ omnipresence is across all of the sciences. Peano’s induction rule gives us a way of formalizing the reasoning or inference procedure for the statement in such a system. The induction rule is given as follows.</p>
<p>A statement <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is true for all natural numbers if</p>

<p>This induction rule is essential. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(S(0)\)</span> is just a fact for zero. The standard implication <span class="math inline">\(S(0)\Rightarrow S(1)\)</span> can only make reasoning for two numbers, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. But there are infinite natural numbers. By using the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to represent any possible naturals, we can apply the implication <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\Rightarrow S(x+1)\)</span> infinitely many times. This application of variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> extends the reasoning from two numbers to infinite natural numbers.</p>
<p>Here is a specific use of the induction rule. Consider <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\)</span> as an equation
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
0+1+2+\cdots+x=\frac{x(x+1)}{2}.
\end{equation*}\]</span>
We can prove that this equation is true by proving (i) <span class="math inline">\(0=0(0+1)/2\)</span> and (ii) if <span class="math inline">\(S(x)\)</span> is true, then the equation <span class="math inline">\(S(x+1)\)</span>, namely
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
0+1+\cdots+x+(x+1)=&amp;    \frac{x(x+1)}{2}+(x+1) \\
=\frac{(x+1)(x+2)}{2}   &amp;=\frac{(x+1)((x+1)+1)}{2},
\end{align*}\]</span>
is also true. This induction extends the reasoning about finite objects to infinite ones.</p>
